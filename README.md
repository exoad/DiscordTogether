This is a simple Discord bot that will aim to enable the Discord Together feature :)

This is a WIP (work in progress)

`More will be added here as time goes on`

You can add this bot to your server [here](https://top.gg/bot/871153531430785086)

### Forking & How to use

First read the [license](./LICENSE.md) for more information about uses, anyways, if you want to use this bot, simply just clone or fork this repo to your own server (a computer where you host the bot). Make sure you have the following installed:
`npm
nodejs
`
Then after that, run the following command in the cloned folder:
`npm i` 

this will install the necessary dependencies for the bot.

After that, go to the file: [token.json](./src/token.json). Replace `$[t.json[1]]$` with a bot token from Discord Developer Portal.

Then type `node .`! :D
